ShockWave: Impulse Response Function (IRF) Visualizer
 
A Streamlite app to visualize IRF function of Time Series(Financial Time Series) using VAR.

How It Works?
    - Input Multiple Stock Tickers and Timer Horizon.
    - Plot IRF i.e See how a sudden shock in one stock have ripples over he other.

Why do you need it?
    - VAR captures interdependency of variables, how exactly one is dependent on the other.
    - IRF simulates sudden market shock and notes how the other behaves when shock is presented.
